# Particle-Assignment-Renderer
This project implements a Particle Simulation system, that is designed to process and render large-scale particle systems in real-time, leveraging Cuda to efficiently map particle contributions onto a 2D pixel grid. The system achieves substantial performance gains when levergaing Cuda, compared to CPU-bound approaches.
